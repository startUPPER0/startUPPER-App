# starUPPER 

#### Our project is platform that matches co-founders, startUPPER is a fast paced app so you can find your potential partner within seconds by taking glimpse of his/her ideas, interests, education or location. It is as easy as swiping up or down.


#### So far we have produced 4 of the activities in the front-endi being login, register, notification and chats activities but their connections or designs are not finalized, also our database is nearly finished, we used mySQL for testing since we designed a relational database but we may and probably will change the database choice because of certain restrictions that mySQL applies. We're trying to decide the navigation of app, whether it will be with a top bar or a bottom bar or connections between activities and such. 

#### In the recent future we plan to complete front-end and write the back-end to control user data. We plan to use django for the back-end.
